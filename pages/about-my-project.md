subtitle: trustworthy multimodal AI system
project_title: "Trustworthy Multimodal AI for Skin Cancer Detection"

problem: |
  The main problem we're tackling is the bias and lack of trust in AI systems used for skin cancer detection. A lot of current models tend to struggle with accurately identifying skin issues especially cancerous cells on melanin skin. This often happens because the data used to train these models doesn’t represent a wide range of skin tones. Our goal isn’t just to point out the problem, but to actually build a better model—one that can detect skin cancer accurately and fairly across all skin tones. We're also focused on making sure the model is explainable, so both clinicians and patients can understand how it works and trust the results it gives.
  
approach: |
  The primary approach of this research include:
   Developing a deep learning pipeline that integrates image data with patient metadata for improved classification.
   
   Investigating bias mitigation techniques to ensure fairness across diverse skin tones.
   
   Enhancing model explainability to support clinicians' decision-making and increase patient trust in AI diagnostics
   
outcome: |
  This project gives us the opportunity to develop trustworthy AI models for skin cancer detection using multimodal learning. We will work with both dermatoscopic images and patient metadata, gaining experience with deep learning techniques. We will also apply explainable AI methods like Grad-CAM and SHAP to improve model transparency. The program covers essential data preprocessing techniques, including image rescaling, segmentation, and contrast enhancement, while also addressing critical issues like bias and fairness in AI. By the end of the project, we will have created a functional AI model, written a research paper, and delivered a final presentation showcasing their results.
