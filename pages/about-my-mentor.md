  bio: |
    Ms. Blessing has collaborated with me on AI-related projects over the past two summers (2023 and 2024), demonstrating strong proficiency in Python programming. During the academic year 2022â€“2023, she also worked in my lab for nearly two semesters, where she developed a software tool to support online students in the Photosynthesis and Respiratory Laboratory. Her contributions to AI projects include developing a DNA sequence classifier using machine learning in Summer 2023, and working on plant leaf detection using machine learning and deep learning techniques in Summer 2024. Notably, her work on the DNA classifier project led to a co-authored research publication titled "Ensemble and Transformer Models for Infectious Disease Prediction" (Blessing A, Joseph A, Temileye I, Tijesunimi A, Rahan Md, Pramanik S, 2023), which focused on using transformer models to predict infectious diseases based on human genomic sequences.
