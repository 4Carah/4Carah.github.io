what_i_learned: |
    Today, I jumped right into coding as soon as day 41 began. I’ve been working on the DCAN model, spending most of the morning debugging and trying to fully understand how the model works. It was a lot of trial and error, especially while fine-tuning the code and applying data augmentation techniques. After lunch, we ran into a new challenge, our image folder was too large for Google Colab to handle efficiently. We attempted to compress the folder into a ZIP file and write code to unpack it, but the process is taking longer than expected due to the large volume of images. As always, we ended the day with our daily blog reflections.
    
blockers: |
    Right now, the biggest blocker is how long the model takes to run. It needs nearly the entire day, without interruptions, which adds a lot of stress, especially with deadlines quickly approaching. We're in crunch time, and it’s hard to stay calm when each interruption feels like a setback.

reflection: |
    Today was definitely stressful. Honestly, I think the days leading up to the presentation will continue to be that way. I’m putting a lot of pressure on myself because I want to accomplish everything we set out to do, and even go beyond that. This project means a lot to me, and I see its potential. That’s why I’m pushing so hard; I want it to be something I can truly be proud of in the long run.
