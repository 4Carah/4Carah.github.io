what_i_learned: |
    We began day 24 with our graduate mentor walking us through the problem we had identified and been working on throughout the week. She confirmed that we were on the right track but pointed out that the issue was due to an incorrect file path in the code. Next, we started working on our weekly presentation, filling in our slides and organizing our content. After lunch, we practiced the presentation together before splitting up to record it on Zoom. Later in the day, we returned to our model code, carefully reviewing each section before running it again to ensure everything was functioning correctly. As always, we ended the day by writing our daily blog post.

reflection: |
    Today was a good day. I’m really glad our mentor is back from her conference, we definitely missed having her around. Even though she was available to contact while she was away, it’s just so much easier and more efficient to get support in person. The biggest issue we faced was a coding error, and once she explained it, everything made a lot more sense. I’m also looking forward to next week my birthday is on Tuesday! As a team we also decided to finally use our hour early dismisal that we won during one of the Thursday cohorts, which is exciting.
