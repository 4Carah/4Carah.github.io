what_i_learned: |
    We began Day 33 with a writing workshop led by staff from the Morgan Writing Center. The session focused on foundational skills essential for effective writing, especially when it comes to research papers. We discussed the importance of clarity, structure, and citing sources, and everyone was encouraged to share their personal challenges with writing so the instructors could better assist us in the next session. After lunch, I  started working on code to decrypt hashed website urls so that google colab could access URLs and download images into a folder for one of our datasets. As usual we ended the day with our daily blog post.

reflection: |
    My day was okay overall. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the writing workshop, but I understand how valuable it will be in the long run, especially with our upcoming research paper. The highlight of my day was diving into cybersecurity. I really enjoyed sharing what I knew with the group when we came across hashed data in one of our new datasets. It was fun exploring how to use code to decrypt the hashes and enable google colab to access the images.
