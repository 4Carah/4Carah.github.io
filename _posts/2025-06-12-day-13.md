what_i_learned: |
  On day 13, we started by introducing ourselves and sharing updates on what we’ve been working on, going through each project group. Our group was first to present. After that, we played a game of taboo, where we split into two teams. One person from each group tried to describe a word while another monitored to prevent cheating, and then we switched roles. Next, we played a game of giant jenga, with us taking turns removing blocks from the stack. After lunch, we continued brainstorming ways to merge our three datasets. Once we settled on a plan, we used Google Colab to write and test the code for combining them effectively. As usual, we ended the day by writing our daily blog posts.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a great day! I really enjoyed playing games with my peers, it was a fun way to connect and take a break from work. I was excited to hear that we might be going on field trips. I think an amusement park and activate would be really fun. Although the coding part was a bit stressful today, the most important thing is that we made progress.
