what_i_learned: |
    Today was day 32, and we jumped straight into coding. We encountered a problem with null values in the anatomy site column, which posed a risk to our model’s accuracy. Initially, we considered manually inspecting each patient's images to guess the lesion location, but we realized that guessing anatomical sites wouldn't be ethical. So, we made the decision to drop the rows with null values just hoping this wouldn't significantly impact our model's performance. After that, we continued cleaning the data and converting string values to integers to ensure everything was in the correct format. Once the preprocessing was complete, we trained the model. Surprisingly, it ran successfully and returned 100% accuracy. As usual we ended the day with our daily blog post.

    The biggest challenge this week has been the room we’re working in. There are six of us sharing a very small space, and it often feels cramped and claustrophobic. It can be difficult to move around when needed, which makes collaboration and staying focused more challenging.

reflection: |
    I had a good day today and felt confident about the work we did. I was especially proud of how we handled preprocessing the data, splitting it, and training the model. While there's still a bit to do, achieving 100% accuracy on one of our columns is a strong sign that we’re headed in the right direction. I'm also looking forward to the writing workshop tomorrow because I think it will be essential in helping us strengthen our research paper.
