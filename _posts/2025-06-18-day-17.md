    We began day 17 by addressing common questions, such as when we’ll receive our checks and how to handle missed work. After that, we were given 10 minutes to practice a 30-second pitch about our project but without using any key words from our project title. The goal was to create a pitch that would allow others to guess which group we were in based on the content. Next, we played a survival game where we ranked a list of items in order of importance, imagining we were stranded in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean. After ranking our items, we discussed our lists as a cohort and compared them with the rankings from a Marine’s perspective. Later, we presented our project pitches to the new teacher aides, who tried to guess our project based on our descriptions. Our designated aide then led us in an icebreaker activity. After lunch, our group wrapped up discussions on our mini-projects. We also read a few articles on CNNs and max pooling, followed by a group discussion to deepen our understanding. As usual, we ended the day by writing our daily blog post.

    I had a good day today. One of the highlights was the survival game, which turned out to be funny. My group and I disagreed about where to rank the shaving mirror on our list. I believed it should be in the top five, while the rest of my group thought it was useless and should be placed near the bottom. In the end, I was proven right, the shaving mirror was actually ranked the top three most important items according to the marine's list.
