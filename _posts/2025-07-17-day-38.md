what_i_learned: |
    We began Day 38 with a writing workshop focused on improving our presentation skills and preparing for our 90 second elevator pitches. During the session, we also learned how to summarize literature reviews more effectively by clearly stating limitations at the end of each summary. After lunch, we reviewed our full code as a group to ensure everyone had a solid understanding before diving back into model training. We also shared ideas for our elevator pitch. To end the day on a high note, our teacher mentor treated us to a team lunch during his mentoring hours, and as always, we ended the day with our daily blog post.

reflection: |
    I had a good day overall, filled with lots of laughs, especially when my group was brainstorming ideas for our elevator pitch. I’m also looking forward to some team bonding outside of our usual work routine, which will be a nice change of pace. One thing that stood out to me was the poll about tomorrow’s workshop. It seemed like everyone voted against it, yet we’re still having it. It makes me curious about the purpose of the poll if the outcome wasn’t going to influence the decision you know.
