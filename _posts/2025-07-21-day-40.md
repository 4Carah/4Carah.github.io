what_i_learned: |
    We started day 40 began with an engaging Overleaf workshop where we learned how to properly format our paper. The session covered everything from inserting titles and authors to organizing sections and references. We had time to practice, giving us a solid foundation for developing our final paper. In the afternoon, we focused on model training, attempting to run two models simultaneously to improve efficiency. As always, we ended the day with our daily blog.
    
blockers: |
    Although it's not a major blocker, having already completed our references and in text citations, it's a bit frustrating to now have to reformat everything to match a different citation style and input it into Overleaf. It feels like a step that adds more work than value at this time in our project.

reflection: |
    Today was a solid day overall. The overleaf workshop was pretty informative and gave us useful tools for formatting our paper. Our project group room was moved to the third floor, there's still some noise, but the extra space is definitely an upgrade, and I’m grateful for that. I’m a little disappointed we’re going to wonderfly instead of topgolf, but I’m sure it’ll still be a fun time with my peers.
