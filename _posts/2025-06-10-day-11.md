what_i_learned: |
  We began day 11 by continuing our exploration of the skin cancer dataset from yesterday using pandas. The session focused on resolving image paths, linking the images to their corresponding metadata, and displaying and plotting some of the images with appropriate titles. After lunch, we used kahoot to review and test our understanding of last week's model lesson as well as the recent panda concepts we learned. Later, we searched for new datasets for our projects after realizing that our current dataset lacks the diversity needed to ensure fairness. We also completed two literature reviews each to support our research. As always, we wrapped up the day by writing and publishing our daily blog post.

  The main challenge I faced today was finding new diverse datasets. Fortunately, my peers and mentor offered helpful suggestions on where to search and what to look for.

reflection: |
  Today was a good day. I really enjoy using code to process data and organize datasets in a way that makes them easier to understand. Although literature reviews aren't my favorite, I’ve found them to be insightful because they help me better understand my project and identify what to focus on or potentially include. I also appreciate that our mentor took our suggestion to use kahoot to test our knowledge because it’s a fun and effective way to reinforce what we've learned.
