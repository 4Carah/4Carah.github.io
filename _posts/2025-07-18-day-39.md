what_i_learned: |
    We began day 39 by splitting up the methodology section of our research paper among the four of us to work more efficiently. My part focused on explaining how and why each of the seven datasets was acquired. Afterward, we shifted to preparing our weekly presentation slides, highlighting our accomplishments from the week. Following lunch, we practiced the presentation and then recorded our video for submission. We ended the afternoon by continuing work on the model training code, filling in key details and adjustments. As always, we ended the day with our daily blog post.

    No Blockers.

reflection: |
    Today was a chill day. Our group had a team lunch, and it was a fun, especially since it was the first time half of the team had ever tried a seafood boil. We shared a lot of laughs and bonded outside of our usual work setting. I’m actually a little excited for our 90 second elevator pitch because I have an idea I think could be really engaging… hopefully my group doesn’t think it’s too corny.
