what_i_learned: |
    We started day 37 by reviewing our to do list and aligning on the day's goals. The first task was creating a visual diagram of our methodology structure, both to clarify our process for the research paper and to present at the end-of-year symposium. After lunch, we created a detailed table to document all seven datasets we’ve worked with, including the dataset name, metadata columns, sample size, and source link. This helped organize our approach and supported the beginning of our methodology section. As usual, we ended the with our daily blog post.
    
blockers: |
    The only blocker we’re currently facing is the workspace environment. The walls in the room are thin, so we can hear not only the other research group but also noise from other programs in the building. It often gets loud and distracting, which makes it difficult to stay focused.

reflection: |
    Today was a good day. I really enjoy organizing my thoughts before writing, so I appreciated that we created both the methodology diagram and the dataset table, they’ll definitely make the writing process easier. I’m mentally preparing for tomorrow’s workshop; I’m not exactly excited about it, but I know it’ll be helpful for improving our paper. It’s hard to believe we only have about two weeks left, the time has gone by so fast.
