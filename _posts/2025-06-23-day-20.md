what_i_learned: |
    We kicked off day 20 by reviewing our to-do list, which included end-to-end model training, preparing for our mid-summer presentation, completing literature reviews, and attending a lecture by our faculty mentor on skin cancer. We prioritized finishing the presentation first to get it out of the way. All that remains now is the live demo and some practice. Next, we shifted focus to literature reviews before diving back into our model training. We revisited the code we had issues with last Friday, located the problem, and started researching solutions. As always, we ended the day by writing our daily blog post.

    A minor challenge today was the absence of our graduate mentor. While she was available to answer our questions via text, it's much easier and more efficient to get clarification and support in person.

reflection: |
    Today was a good and productive day. I'm glad we were able to identify the issue in our code. Now the focus shifts to researching how to implement the solution effectively, understanding where it fits, and making sure I fully grasp the process. As the upcoming presentation approaches, I’m feeling a bit nervous. While I believe we’re well prepared and will do well, I still worry about stumbling over my words, which is something I tend to do during presentations.
