what_i_learned: |
  We began day 9 by completing our week 2 team video. The purpose of the video was to present our group’s project summary, our goals for the current week, share individual progress, and discuss our objectives and next steps for next  week. After finalizing the presentation, we rehearsed it a few times, first to ensure we stayed within the time limit, and second to make sure the content accurately represented our group and met our expectations. After lunch, we had a lecture focused on machine learning, specifically the models we’ll be working with. The session covered their purposes, functions, and how they operate. To reinforce our understanding and support memory retention, we participated in another kahoot game reviewing previous material. As usual, we concluded the day by writing and submitting our daily blog post.

  There were no significant blockers today.

reflection: |
  Today was relatively slow but still productive. I’m grateful that my team and I are often on the same page about things. During the lecture, we noticed our focus and energy starting to dip, so we collectively decided to change the scenery. That small shift made a noticeable difference in our mood and helped us regain momentum.
