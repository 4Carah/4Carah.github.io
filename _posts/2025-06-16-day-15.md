what_i_learned: |
    We began day 15 by watching several videos that explained the fundamentals of machine learning, neural networks, and Keras. Following the videos, we had a group discussion where each of us shared key takeaways and asked questions to clarify any misunderstanding. After lunch, we shifted our focus to the research paper, starting with drafting the abstract and introduction. As usual, we ended the day by writing our daily blog post.

reflection: |
    Today felt like a productive day overall. Although the rainy weather set a gloomy mood, we successfully completed our abstract and made strong progress on the introduction of our research paper. I also gained a clearer understanding of the difference between an abstract and an introduction, something I hadn’t fully grasped before. I learned that the abstract provides a broad overview of the paper, while the introduction is more detailed and specific information.
