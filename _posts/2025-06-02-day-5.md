what_i_learned: |
  Today was the first in person day of the CEMALS AI Research Institute. We started with introductions from the director, staff, faculty mentors, and graduate mentors, followed by a chance to introduce ourselves to one another. We then learned about the purpose of CEMALS and its relevance in today’s world. We participated in a short interactive lesson that explained how AI works and what its current limitations are. Afterw, we took a group photo and began a team building activity. The challenge was to build the tallest tower possible using tape and uncooked spaghetti, with a marshmallow placed at the top. After lunch, we moved to our assigned classrooms with our project groups. We began researching research papers related to our projects, using search terms like AI in Dermatology and Explainable AI in Healthcare. We ended the day by writing our daily blog.

  The main challenge of the day was researching academic papers for our project. It turned out to be more time-consuming than I expected, trying to find high quality, relevant sources required a lot of careful searching, and reading. While it was a bit frustrating at times, it also helped me better understand how to navigate medical literature and recognize credible information.

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed my first day in person. My favorite part was the team-building activity with my group. The way we communicated and collaborated during the challenge gave me a lot of confidence in our ability to work well together moving forward. I felt a genuine connection with my teammates and hope we become good friends over time. I'm also looking forward to meeting and connecting with others outside my group as the program continues.
