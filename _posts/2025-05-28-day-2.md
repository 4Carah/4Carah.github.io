    Today, Day 2, we met our faculty lead and graduate mentor. Within breakout rooms we introduced ourselves and got to talk about what should be expected of us. We continued from where we left off yesterday by completing the code for our daily blog post. We finalized the home page by adding our pictures as a finishing touch. Additionally, we began working on the "About Me" section on GitHub to further personalize our profiles. After a short lunch break, we were divided into two groups based on the results of our placement test. I was assigned to Group 1, which is the beginner group. In our session, we explored key programming concepts including integers, floats, strings, and functions. We played kahoot between parts to acknowledge our understanding n said topics. 

  To refresh our minds, we took a short brain break and played a round of "Heads Up." We wrapped up the day by writing and submitting our blog post for Day 2.

    The only minor challenge of the day occurred during our "Heads Up" game, when it was my turn to guess and I wasn’t able to figure out the word in time.

reflection: |
    I gained basic knowledge of Python that I haven't been exposed to before and was surprised by how quickly I was able to get the concepts. I particularly enjoyed debugging my code, as it allowed me to identify and resolve issues on my own. I’ve already noticed growth in both my skills and confidence, especially after finalizing my home page, starting the "About Me" section, and learning how to create and manage my daily blog posts. I also gained more knowledge about my mentors and what they expect of us these upcoming weeks.
