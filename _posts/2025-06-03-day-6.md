what_i_learned: |
  Today we dedicated the entire day to further develop our Python skills. We used W3Schools, an interactive website, to learn new concepts and practice coding. Before lunch, each member of my group took turns going up to the board to demonstrate a Python concept we felt confident with. This gave us the opportunity to both teach and learn from one another. We challenged each other with questions, worked through errors as a team, and discussed solutions. When we encountered concepts that were unclear, our group mentor stepped in to provide guidance and explanations, helping us reach a better understanding. After lunch, we returned to group work for a bit before transitioning back to individual practice using the W3Schools platform. We wrapped up the day by writing and submitting our daily blog post.

  My biggest challenge today was managing the frustration that comes with memory retention. Python involves a lot of concepts, and I sometimes find myself needing to look back at notes or resources to remember certain things. It can be discouraging at times, but I know my recall will improve with consistent practice.

reflection: |
  Knowing how important Python is to our project makes me even more determined to fully grasp the concepts, even if that means practicing outside of the internship. I want to build a solid foundation so I can contribute more effectively. I’m also thinking about planning a team bonding activity outside of the internship. I think that by strengthening our connection, we can better understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which will help us work more efficiently as a team. Today, a former CEAMLS SAIRI participant reminded us just how essential teamwork is, and that message really stuck with me.
