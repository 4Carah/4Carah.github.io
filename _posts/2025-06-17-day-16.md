    We started day 16 by reviewing the code we had previously written together to merge the three datasets we found. After going through it, we decided it would be more effective for each of us to complete the same mini-project individually. Once finished, we planned to review our work as a group, discussing any mistakes we made or concepts we still found confusing. The mini project involved merging three different hospital records into a single dataset. This exercise helped reinforce our understanding of data merging while ensuring that everyone could complete the task on their own, with no one left behind. As usual, we ended the day by writing our daily blog post.

reflection: |
    Today was good, but a bit slow paced. I really appreciate that, as a team, we can all come to a shared understanding of how we learn best. My project group thrives with hands on learning so mini projects have proven to be the most effective way for us to grasp concepts quickly. I struggled a bit with my mini project today, but once I took a step back and gave myself time to think, things started to click for me. I'm looking forward to meeting our teacher aide tomorrow and i'm curious to see what the dynamic will be like.
