    Today on day 27, we started by discussing our plan and outlining our tasks for the day. We began with a code review session in preparation for the demo video that will be part of our presentation slides. To ensure everything fit within our allotted time, we practiced and timed the demo segment alongside our full presentation. Following this, we rehearsed the entire presentation, keeping it under the 20 minute limit including the demo video. After lunch, we recorded our live demo and integrated the final video into our slide deck. Once everything was assembled, we completed a full run-through of the presentation. We made sure to ask our teacher and mentor for feedback and also requested potential test questions to help us prepare. As usual, we ended the day by writing our daily blog post.

    Surprisingly, my main challenge today was staying within the allotted time limit. I originally thought it would be difficult to speak for a full 20 minutes, but it turned out to be the opposite, I found we went over time more easily than expected.

reflection: |
    Today was a productive day. I was surprised that staying within the allotted time turned out to be our biggest challenge. We had to condense a lot of information and focus on giving clear, concise explanations in both the demo video and the presentation. To prepare for any follow up questions or missed points, we made sure we fully understood everything we were presenting. I'm feeling a bit nervous about tomorrow’s presentation, but also excited to share what we’ve been working on.
