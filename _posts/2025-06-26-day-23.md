what_i_learned: |
    We began day 23 by watching videos on machine learning, Keras, deep learning, and related topics. The goal is to strengthen our  knowledge so that we can confidently explain these concepts to others and to prepare for next week’s symposium. We also discussed our video demo. Our main focus is on improving the accuracy of our current model, which is not  performing at the level we’re aiming to show. We did literature reviews to gain insight into how other AI models have performed and where they may have fallen short. As always, we ended the day by writing our daily blog post.

reflection: |
    Today was a pretty chill day, which is always a win to me. I missed yesterday, but thankfully I didn’t fall too far behind. My group helped catch me up on the new topics I missed, which I really appreciated. I have mixed feelings about the presentation being pushed back to next week. On one hand, I had mentally prepared myself for presenting on Friday. On the other hand, I’m choosing to see it as extra time to practice and make sure I can explain everything clearly and confidently.
