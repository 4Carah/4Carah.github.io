what_i_learned: |
    We began Day 36 with a cohort-wide session focused on “Hack your research projects” through personality awareness. Everyone took two personality tests, and we worked in our project groups to create a three-slide presentation that included our test results, a project summary, and a list of strengths and challenges based on our combined personalities. After presenting, we participated in a gallery walk to explore how other teams function based on their personality dynamics. In the afternoon, I focused on refining our data augmentation code, then our group reviewed the abstract and introduction of our research paper, making small edits based on our teacher mentor's feedback. We also began outlining the methodology section and discussed how we want to present our process. To wrap up, we invited our mentors to take the same personality tests to see how their styles complement our group. As always, we ended the day with our daily blog post.

reflection: |
    I had a pretty good day. I always enjoy cohort sessions where we get to interact with other groups, it’s refreshing and a nice change of pace. While my group had mixed feelings about how accurate the personality tests were, we all agreed that our personalities mesh well since we’re often on the same wavelength and share similar ideas. I also met another all girl group who felt the same way, which was really cool and relatable.
