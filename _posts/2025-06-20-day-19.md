what_i_learned: |
    We began day 19 by completing our weekly presentation slides. Once finished, we shifted our focus to coding a method for dataset splitting based on skin tones to promote fairness, using the 40/30/30 distribution approach. We first calculated the current sample counts for each skin tone category, identified the smallest category, and used our target proportions to determine a total sample size. After lunch, we recorded our weekly presentation and then moved on to splitting our data into training and testing sets. With that complete, we began training our model. Later in the afternoon, our faculty mentor gave a detailed lesson on the biology of skin cancer, covering diagnosis and answering our questions to deepen our understanding. As always, we ended the day with our daily blog post.
    
blockers: |
    My blocker today was getting the model training started in Keras. We had the correct structure and a good understanding of the workflow, but something critical is still missing in the code that we haven’t been able to pinpoint yet.

reflection: |
    I had a good and productive day. I came in knowing that two of our project members would be absent, which I initially thought might create a challenging dynamic. However, my remaining teammate and I handled it well. We confidently took over presenting the weekly slides and collaborated effectively on the day’s coding tasks. We also made sure to fully understand the material so we can clearly explain and hopefully teach our project mates what we accomplished when we return on monday.
