 what_i_learned: |
   We began day 3 with a computer vision lesson led by Andrew Kelly. During this session, we explored the key differences between object detection and image classification. To deepen our understanding, we used Teachable Machine and Google Colab for hands-on activities that demonstrated real-world applications of these concepts. After the lesson, we broke into our project groups to communicate and work through the challenges of a team-based escape room activity. After a short lunch break, we got into our Python groups for a deeper dive into programming fundamentals. The session focused on converting strings to integers, digital profiles using variables, and I/O (Input/Output) cycle through practical examples. We end the day creating our 3 day daily blog.
  
 blockers: | 
   I encountered a couple of blockers today. The first was not completing the escape room in time, which fustrated me. The second was an unknown error in my Day 2 blog post code, which was frustrating at firstbut with some help, we figured it out, and everything is running normally again.
  
 reflection: |
  Overall, day 3 was both productive and engaging by collaborative learning and meaningful hands-on exploration. I particularly enjoyed working with Teachable Machine and Google Colab, the activities were not only informative but also sparked a genuine interest in computer vision. I'm excited to explore these tools further in my own time. In addition, I feel increasingly confident in my Python skills. Each session builds on the last, so I'm slowly gaining a deeper understanding of programming fundamentals.
