 We began Day 7 by continuing our work on Python concepts. Shortly afterward, we participated in a team-building exercise, Two truths and a lie. The twist was that each statement had to relate to our interests or experience with machine learning. All because of the connections we've built over the past week, we were actually good at identifying each other's lies. Next, we moved on to our project and interest pitch session. Each of us presented a proposal that included the problem statement, approach outline, trustworthiness components, and milestone goals for the next four weeks. After sharing our ideas, we collaborated to put all of our pitches into one document for future reflection and planning. After lunch, we wrapped up the remaining Python concepts for the day and tested our understanding with a Kahoot game. As usual we ended the day by writing our daily blog posts.

  A challenge I faced today was during our pitch discussions—I realized I wasn’t familiar with many of the models and tools we’ll be using. At first, it was a bit overwhelming, but I reminded myself that it’s okay not to know everything right now. With the time and research, I’ll gain a better understanding.

reflection: |
  I had a great day today. I enjoyed the project and interest pitch that our graduate mentor encouraged us to present. It was insightful to see how each of us had a unique perspective on the project while still sharing common goals and ideas. A highlight for me was winning first place in our Kahoot game. It gave me a real confidence boost and reassured me that the time I've spent studying and practicing is paying off.
