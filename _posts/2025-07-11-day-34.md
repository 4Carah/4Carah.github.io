what_i_learned: |
    We began day 4 by continuing to refine the code we had worked on the previous day. Once we completed individual sections, we merged all our scripts into a single, codebase making it easier to reference and use for our model moving forward. After lunch, we shifted our focus to preparing slides for our weekly presentation. During this time, we shared our accomplishments, discussed challenges, and talked about our goals for the upcoming week. We then split into rooms to record our weekly presentation on zoom. As always, we ended the day with our daily blog posts.

reflection: |
    Today was a productive day, and I felt accomplishmented after completing my code. However, I ran into an unexpected challenge, the dataset included a large number of skin conditions and diseases that weren’t relevant to our project. Now, I’ll need to sort and filter the images to keep only what’s necessary. I’m glad it’s Friday though because this week felt especially long.
