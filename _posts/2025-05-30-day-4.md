   Day 4 of CEMALS SAIRI 2025 Summer AI Research Institute, We began the day with a pre-survey to reflect on our expectations and current knowledge going into the program. After that, we returned to our Python groups for a deeper dive into core Python concepts. Today, we focused on logical operators, conditionals, booleans, relational operators and comparison operators. To wrap up our coding session, we created a final mini-project: a student grade evaluator. This program took test scores (ranging from 1 to 100) and returned both a letter grade and a personalized comment for the student. Following a short lunch break, we shifted gears with a lesson on generative AI. To reinforce our understanding, we participated in several Kahoot quizzes. One of the highlights of the afternoon was a fun and challenging game of Bot or Not, where we had to guess whether images were AI-generated or real. As usual, we closed the day by writing and submitting our daily blog post.

  Overall, I had a fun and engaging day, especially while working on the mini project. I ran into a few challenges along the way, but with some problem-solving, I was excited to finally see the results I was aiming for. I also really enjoyed the Kahoot quizzes because they were a great way to test my understanding and helped boost my confidence in what Iâ€™ve learned so far. Collaborating with my peers during the generative AI lesson was another highlight. It was great to hear their ideas and connect with them more, both as teammates and friends.
