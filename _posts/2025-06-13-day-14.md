what_i_learned: |
    Starting off Day 14, the final day of the week, we began by finishing up our weekly presentation to get it out of the way. We added our information to the slides and did a quick run-through to practice. After that, I went to a separate area to record the presentation. Once that was completed, we jumped straight into coding, reviewing the progress we made yesterday. We then wrote code to ensure that all datasets had matching columns and printed in the same format. As usual, we wrapped up the day by writing our daily blog.
    
blockers: |
    The main challenge today was that our code which ran without issues yesterday, suddenly started throwing an error. This was an unexpected disruption in the progress we had made and set us back a bit. We had to spend time investigating why the error appeared and what might have caused it, while also working on a more stable fix to prevent it from happening again.

reflection: |
    Today was alright overall, but the sudden issue with our code really threw me off. It was definitely a setback, especially since that time could’ve been used to make more progress elsewhere. What made it even more frustrating was that the code had run perfectly earlier in the day, and without anyone changing anything, it just stopped working after lunch.
