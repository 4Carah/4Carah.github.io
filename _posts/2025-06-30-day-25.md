what_i_learned: |
    We started off day 25 with a check in and shared how our weekends went. After reviewing the to-do list, we knew the day’s goals. We started by carefully reading through the code that handles data splitting and model setup, making sure everyone in the group understood each part. Following lunch, our teacher mentor shared a midsummer presentation from last year, giving us ideas on how to keep ours concise and engaging. We then fine tuned our own presentation. We practiced explaining the code with our mentor, and she provided helpful feedback and answered questions to deepen our understanding. As always, we ended the day with our daily blog post.

reflection: |
    Today was a good day overall. As the mid-summer presentation approaches, I’m starting to feel a bit nervous again. Not because I lack knowledge or anything, but because I want to make sure I sound confident when presenting. To prepare, I plan to practice outside of work to improve both my delivery and projection. On an exciting note, my birthday is tomorrow, and I’m really excited about it!
