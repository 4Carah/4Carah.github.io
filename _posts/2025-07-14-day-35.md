what_i_learned: |
    We began day 35 by reviewing our to do list for the day. We quickly got to work finalizing the last steps of our preprocessing before merging and splitting our datasets. One major change we made was revisiting an earlier decision, we initially focused on a dataset with a large number of darker skin tones, but later decided to retrieve and include the remaining patients skin tones and corresponding images to ensure better model performance through more diverse data. We also began writing code for the three algorithms we plan to implement Grad-CAM, SHAP, and DCAN. As always, we ended the day with our daily blog post.

    No blockers.

reflection: |
    Today was a productive day. While reviewing one of our datasets, we noticed a value of -1 in the skin tone column, which we learned represents individuals with albino skin. I thought it was really interesting and important that our dataset allows us to account for that level of inclusivity in skin tone representation. On another note, the current workspace has been a bit distracting for me due to the constant movement and noise, which makes it harder to stay focused.
