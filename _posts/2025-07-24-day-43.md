what_i_learned: |
    I started day 43 by jumping straight into debugging the DCAN model. After several rounds of troubleshooting and adjustments, I finally got the model up and running. I trained it for 40 epochs, which took about two hours to complete. During training, I monitored the validation accuracy, which hovered around 0.6, while the accuracy loss continued to rise. Once training wrapped up, I implemented code to generate random predictions and added some data augmentation to address the validation loss. I ended the day with my daily blog post.

    Crunch Time!!!!!

reflection: |
    I had a good day overall. I felt a huge sense of relief after successfully training the model and seeing it reach a decent level of accuracy. There's still more fine-tuning ahead, but I'm excited to keep pushing forward and see how much the model can improve. Part of me is happy that tomorrow is Friday, but it also means we're getting closer to the symposium, which definitely has me feeling nervous.
