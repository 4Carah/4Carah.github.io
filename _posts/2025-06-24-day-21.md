what_i_learned: |
    We kicked off day 21 together as a full cohort. The morning session gave us a chance to go over details about our upcoming final presentation and stipends. We also had time to ask questions and share concerns. Before heading back to our lab groups, we spent a few minutes mingling and catching up. Once we returned to our labs, we jumped straight into coding. Our model is up and running, however, the results still aren’t where we’d like them to be, so we spent the majority of the day refining the model and troubleshooting issues to improve performance. We also talked about the final presentation and agreed it would be helpful to practice a few times before Friday. As always, we ended the day by writing our daily blog post.
    
blockers: |
    My blocker today was debugging and troubleshooting the model training, which turned out to be very frustrating.

reflection: |
    Today wasn’t the best for me. I found myself feeling stressed and frustrated for a good part of the day. On top of that, it wasn’t our usual day to meet as a cohort, so I felt a bit anxious going into the meeting, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Thankfully, it turned out to be nothing serious. The meeting ended up being more helpful than I anticipated. The presentation time was reduced from 20 minutes to 15. That honestly took a lot of pressure off, I had no idea how I was going to talk for a full 20 minutes straight.
