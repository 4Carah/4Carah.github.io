what_i_learned: |
    I started day 45 with a check in to answer any remaining questions from my teacher mentor about our project. I made sure to give detailed explanations and asked follow up questions to ensure he felt confident for his presentation. After that, I ran my DCAN model so I could generate plots and tables based on the results. Following lunch, I focused on editing and adding to our methodology section. I also applied more data augmentation and re ran the model, hoping for improved accuracy. As always, I ended the day with my daily blog post.

reflection: |
     Today was a productive and rewarding day. It felt good to be appreciated by my teacher mentor after taking the time to explain some of the finer details of our project to help him feel more confident for his presentation. Time feels like it’s flying by earlier I wanted it to move faster, but now I find myself wishing it would slow down just a little. We're getting closer to the symposium, which definitely has me feeling nervous.
