what_i_learned: |
  We kicked off day 8 with a campus tour of Morgan State University. During the tour, we visited various buildings while our mentors explained the purpose of each one and the types of classes held there. After the tour, we reviewed example group videos to better understand the format and expectations for our weekly Friday presentations. We also had a brief discussion about the status of our stipends. After lunch, we did a Kahoot refresher to apply the Python concepts we've been learning. Then, each of us completed a different mini-project to apply our skills. My project was a unique word extractor. We ended the day, as usual, by writing our daily blog post.

blockers: |
  My main blocker today was the heat during the campus tour. Since I already attend Morgan State University, the tour wasn’t as exciting or new for me as it was for some of my peers. However, I did learn a few new things.

reflection: |
  Although I’m not a fan of the heat, I still had a good day. The campus tour gave me a chance to connect and talk with people outside of my group, which was nice. I initially struggled with my mini project, but my graduate mentor was really helpful when walking me through my small mistakes and helping me understand where I went wrong. I also really appreciate Michael, the CEMALS coordinator, for accommodating my group’s need for an air-conditioned room.
