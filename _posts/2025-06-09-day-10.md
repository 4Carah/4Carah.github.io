what_i_learned: |
  I began day 10 by replying to my peers week two videos and reviewing the comments left on my project video for feedback. Next, I visited W3Schools to learn the basic concepts of Pandas in preparation for our afternoon lesson. After lunch, we had an interactive session exploring Pandas and data frames. Using practice datasets, we learned how to search for specific columns, identify missing data, and create graphs. As usual, we ended the day by writing our daily blog post.

blockers: |
  There were no significant blockers today.

reflection: |
  I had a good day today. I got to see sample images of the data we’ll be working with, and let’s just say it reminded me exactly why I never considered becoming a doctor. Despite that, the more progress we make, the more excited I get about the project. It’s starting to feel like everything we’re learning is coming together.
