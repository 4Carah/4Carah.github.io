 what_i_learned: |
   Today was my first day interning with the 2025 Ceamls SAIRI Internship program. We started by introducing ourselves through a short questionnaire on Zoom. To help us get to know each other better, we played a networking bingo game. Later we were introduced to Git, a version control system, and GitHub, a platform for hosting and collaborating on code.

   We took a placment test to assess our knowledge on python. I felt intimaidated at first, But i realized the test is for our benifit.
  
 reflection: |
  I had a great first day at the Summer AI Research Institute and am excited to begin working with my peers and mentors on the Trustworthy Multimodal AI for Skin Cancer Detection project. I'm especially looking forward to continuing my work with GitHub—I really enjoy the idea of building our own website and developing individual pages through code.
