  Today was my first day interning with the 2025 Ceamls SAIRI Internship program. We started by introducing ourselves through a short questionnaire on Zoom. To help us get to know each other better, we played a networking bingo game. Later we were introduced to Git, a version control system, and GitHub, a platform for hosting and collaborating on code.
