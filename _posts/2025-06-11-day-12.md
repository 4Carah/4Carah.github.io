  We started off day 12 with a team check in, sharing our thoughts and experiences regarding the program so far, our group dynamics, and the overall pace of our work. Following the check in, we resumed our search for more diverse datasets, specifically focusing on finding skin cancer data featuring darker skin tones, and we were successful. After lunch, we split into pairs to conduct two separate literature reviews. Once everyone finished, we came back together to share our findings and ask questions, which sparked an insightful discussion. In the afternoon, we brainstormed ways to merge our datasets effectively. To begin this process, we identified common subgroups across the data, such as age, diagnosis, sex, image ID, and skin tone. As usual, we ended the day with our daily blog post.

reflection: |
  Today was incredibly productive. I spent time exploring our CSV data using Google Colab, and I was proud to realize I still remembered the coding skills needed to navigate it. One of the highlights of the day was finding more diverse datasets, especially those representing darker skin tones. This was a major concern for us and a crucial aspect of our project, so it felt like a huge step forward.
