what_i_learned: |
    we began day 41 by working on our XGBoost and DCAN models. Due to long runtimes and limited time remaining, we made the decision to resample our 22 diagnosis classes down to 8, allowing for more manageable training and evaluation under our time crunch. After lunch, we began staging our skit for the project pitch. To bring our characters to life, we asked our teacher mentor for lab coats to add a bit more flair. We did a few dry runs before officially recording the pitch. While we had a general plan, we ended up improvising and adding a few creative elements during filming. Once we had our final shots, we discussed editing directions and how we wanted the final video to look. As usual, we ended the day with our daily blog post.

    Crunch Time!!!!!

reflection: |
    Today was a lot of fun, especially during the recording and directing of our elevator pitch. It took some time since we couldn't stop laughing, but it was refreshing to step away from our usual routine of coding and writing. One of our group members was hesitant to be on camera, but i was happy to see her step out of her comfort zone and be part of the process.
