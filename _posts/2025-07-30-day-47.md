what_i_learned: |
    I started day 47 by working on sections of the presentation slides. I decided to run the model one last time and ended up with the highest accuracy so far. I added the new results to the literature review and updated the matching slides. After lunch, worked on revising the end of year presentation. The team ran a dry run to check timing and structure, which led to a lot of fine-tuning across all sections. As always, i ended the day with my daily blog post.

    Crunch Time!!!!!

reflection: |
     Today was a productive and rewarding day. It felt good to be appreciated by my teacher mentor after taking the time to explain some of the finer details of our project to help him feel more confident for his presentation. Time feels like it’s flying by earlier I wanted it to move faster, but now I find myself wishing it would slow down just a little. We're getting closer to the symposium, which definitely has me feeling nervous.
