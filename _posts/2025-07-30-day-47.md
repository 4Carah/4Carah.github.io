what_i_learned: |
    I started day 47 by working on sections of the presentation slides. I decided to run the model one last time and ended up with the highest accuracy so far. I added the new results to the literature review and updated the matching slides. After lunch, worked on revising the end of year presentation. The team ran a dry run to check timing and structure, which led to a lot of fine-tuning across all sections. As always, i ended the day with my daily blog post.

    Crunch Time!!!!!

reflection: |
     Today felt bittersweet. There was some anxiety thinking about everything left to finish and the big presentation tomorrow. It was hard knowing this would be the last time in this space with the group, it really feels like the end. But there’s also a lot of gratitude. Proud of the work accomplished, thankful for the opportunity, and excited about a new interest that grew from it. Going to miss the connections made and the experience of building something meaningful together.
