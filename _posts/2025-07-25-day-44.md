what_i_learned: |
    I started day 44 off with an presentation by Chris Crawford. He started by sharing a bit about his life beyond tech, then walked us through some of the projects he's worked on. One highlight was seeing how brainwaves were used to control games, including a project he did with an all deaf school. After the talk, our cohort split into two interactive sessions,one focused on programming a robot using our arm muscles, and the other used facial muscle movements like jaw clenching and blinking to control a drone. After lunch, I got back to refining my model, applying data augmentation and further filtering the datasets. As always, I ended the day with my daily blog post.

reflection: |
    Today was a pretty cool day. I especially enjoyed the interactive sessions that Chris Crawford organized for us, it was cool to see how programming combined with our own muscle signals could control something like a drone or robot. I'm also happy to see that the model's accuracy improved compared to the earlier training sessions. Part of me is happy that its Friday, but it also means we're getting closer to the symposium, which definitely has me feeling nervous.
